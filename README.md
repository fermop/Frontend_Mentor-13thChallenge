## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

  - Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - What is BEM? BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. Itâ€™s a CSS naming convention for writing cleaner and more readable CSS classes. BEM also aims to write independent CSS blocks in order to reuse them later in your project.
- [Josh Comeauâ€™s CSS reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This reset makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need to be reset.
